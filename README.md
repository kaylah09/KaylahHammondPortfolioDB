# KaylahHammondPortfolioDB
This database was designed as part of my Software Application Development portfolio to represent my technical skills in database design, SQL development, and real-world data modeling. The schema organizes my personal projects, the technologies I use, my work and student experience, and my ongoing internship/co-op applications.
